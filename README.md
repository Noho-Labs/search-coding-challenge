# search-coding-challenge

## Welcome to our search coding challenge! Here is how to get started

### Run the frontend app

- ([Download Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm))
- Open up the `search-react-app` folder
- Run `npm install` to install the libraries
- Run `npm run dev` to start the frontend local server
- Go to `http://localhost:5173/` and prosper!

### Run the backend server

- Make sure to have python 3.12 and pip installed!
- Open up the `backend` folder

- Install all requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- run `python app.py`. You should see a local server running! You can confirm this by going to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` -- you should see a message `Flask with MySQL is set up!`.
